# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## **Product Overview**
The WeatherGov Ruby Client is a Ruby library designed to interact with the [weather.gov API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api). The client will initially support endpoints for retrieving weather forecasts and alerts, with plans to expand to all available endpoints in the future. The client will prioritize performance, security, and developer usability, adhering to best practices for API integration and Ruby development.

---

## **Goals and Objectives**
1. Provide a simple, intuitive interface for interacting with the weather.gov API.
2. Minimize API calls by implementing caching where appropriate.
3. Ensure the client is respectful of weather.gov resources, even in the absence of rate limits.
4. Package the client as a Ruby Gem for easy distribution and installation.
5. Maintain 100% unit test coverage to ensure reliability and robustness.
6. Use YARD for comprehensive and developer-friendly documentation.
7. Support only actively maintained Ruby versions receiving security updates.
8. Log detailed error information for debugging while exposing minimal error details to the user.
9. Include built-in support for transforming API responses into Ruby objects for ease of use.

## **Functional Requirements**

### **1. Supported Endpoints**
#### **Phase 1 (Initial Release)**
- **Weather Forecasts**:
  - Retrieve weather forecasts for a given location (latitude/longitude).
  - Support both grid-based and point-based forecast retrieval.
- **Weather Alerts**:
  - Retrieve active weather alerts for a given location or region.

#### **Phase 2 (Future Expansion)**
- Support all other endpoints provided by the weather.gov API, including:
  - Observation stations.
  - Historical weather data.
  - Gridpoint metadata.

---

### **2. API Call Optimization**
- **Caching**:
  - Implement caching for API responses where appropriate (e.g., forecasts that do not change frequently).
  - Use an in-memory caching mechanism that does not persist beyond the lifetime of the client.
  - Caching should not be configurable by the user.
  - Automatically invalidate cached data when it becomes stale.
- **Respectful Usage**:
  - Avoid unnecessary or redundant API calls.
  - Provide mechanisms to reuse previously fetched data when possible.

---

### **3. Security**
- **Client Identification**:
  - Include an email address in the `User-Agent` header as required by weather.gov.
  - Example: `User-Agent: WeatherGovRubyClient/1.0 (contact@example.com)`.
- **Secure Communication**:
  - Enforce HTTPS for all API requests.
  - Validate API responses to ensure they conform to expected formats.

---

### **4. Error Handling**
- **User-Facing Errors**:
  - Provide minimal error details to the user (e.g., "Invalid coordinates" or "API unavailable").
- **Logging**:
  - Log detailed error information (e.g., HTTP status codes, response bodies, stack traces) to a configurable log file.
  - Use a standard logging library (e.g., `Logger`) for consistency.

---

### **5. Testing**
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Achieve 100% unit test coverage.
  - Use RSpec as the testing framework.
  - Mock API responses to avoid making real API calls during tests.
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Validate correct handling of successful API responses.
  - Validate error handling for various failure scenarios (e.g., network errors, invalid inputs).
  - Test caching behavior to ensure it works as expected.
  - Test edge cases, such as empty responses or unexpected data formats.
- **Coverage Tool**:
  - Use `SimpleCov` to measure and enforce test coverage.
---

### **6. Documentation**
- **YARD**:
  - Use YARD to generate developer-friendly documentation.
  - Include detailed descriptions of all public methods, parameters, and return values.
  - Provide examples of common use cases (e.g., fetching a forecast, handling errors).

---

### **7. Ruby Version Support**
- Support only Ruby versions that are actively maintained and receiving security updates.
- Regularly review and update supported versions as Ruby versions reach end-of-life.

---

### **8. Packaging and Distribution**
- Package the client as a Ruby Gem.
- Publish the gem to [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org).
- Follow semantic versioning (e.g., `1.0.0` for the initial release).

---

### **9. Dependencies**
- Use external gems only when necessary.
- Evaluate the pros and cons of each dependency:
  - **Pros**: Reduced development time, community support, reliability.
  - **Cons**: Increased gem size, potential security risks, dependency management overhead.
- Suggested dependencies:
  - **Faraday**: For HTTP requests (lightweight and flexible).
  - **Oj** or **JSON**: For JSON parsing.
  - **Logger**: For logging.

---

### **10. Data Transformations**
- Convert API responses into plain Ruby objects (POROs) for ease of use.
- Provide a consistent interface for accessing response data (e.g., `forecast.temperature` instead of raw JSON).
- Validate and sanitize API responses before transforming them into Ruby objects.
- Ensure the transformation logic is modular and reusable across different endpoints.
- Avoid using external libraries like `dry-struct` to minimize dependencies and keep the implementation lightweight.
- **Example**:
  ```ruby
  class Forecast
    attr_reader :temperature, :humidity, :wind_speed

    def initialize(temperature:, humidity:, wind_speed:)
      @temperature = temperature
      @humidity = humidity
      @wind_speed = wind_speed
    end
  end

---

### **11. Technical Debt Avoidance**
- Adhere to clean code principles, including modular design, single responsibility, and separation of concerns.
- Conduct regular code reviews to ensure maintainability and adherence to coding standards.
- Use RuboCop to enforce consistent coding practices.
- Refactor code regularly to address technical debt and improve readability.

---
### **12. Scalability and Resilience**
- Design the client to handle high-concurrency scenarios gracefully.
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures.
- Include fallback mechanisms for degraded performance (e.g., returning cached data if the API is unavailable).
- Monitor and log API response times to identify performance bottlenecks.

---

### **13. CI/CD Pipeline**
- Use a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, linting, and deployment.
- Ensure all tests pass and RuboCop reports no offenses before merging changes.
- Use tools like GitHub Actions or CircleCI for continuous integration.
- Automate the deployment of the gem to RubyGems.org after passing all checks.

---

### **14. Dependency Management**
- Lock dependencies using `Gemfile.lock` to ensure consistent builds.
- Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities using tools like `bundler-audit` or `dependabot`.
    - Avoid unnecessary dependencies to minimize the attack surface and reduce maintenance overhead.

---

### **15. Error Handling**
- Use custom error classes to categorize errors (e.g., `ClientError`, `ServerError`, `NetworkError`).
- Define a clear hierarchy for error classes:
  - `WeatherGovApi::Error` (base class for all errors).
  - `WeatherGovApi::ClientError` (for 4xx errors).
  - `WeatherGovApi::ServerError` (for 5xx errors).
  - `WeatherGovApi::NetworkError` (for network-related issues).
- Log detailed error information, including HTTP status codes and response bodies, for debugging.
- Expose minimal error details to the user (e.g., "Invalid input" or "Service unavailable").
- Implement retry logic for recoverable errors (e.g., network timeouts).

---
### **16. Logging**
- Use structured logging (e.g., JSON format) for easier parsing and analysis.
- Allow configurable log levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, and `ERROR`.
- Ensure logs do not contain sensitive information (e.g., API keys, user data).
- Write logs to a configurable destination (e.g., file, stdout).
- Include detailed error information in logs, such as HTTP status codes, response bodies, and stack traces.
- **Example Log Entry**:
  ```json
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-05-03T12:00:00Z",
    "level": "ERROR",
    "message": "API request failed",
    "context": {
      "endpoint": "/points/39.7456,-97.0892",
      "status_code": 500,
      "response_body": "Internal Server Error"
    }
  }
